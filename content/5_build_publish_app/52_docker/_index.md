We will now build a Docker image with our NPM package and publish the image to our JFrog Artifactory repository.

![JFrog CLI Docker](/images/jfrog-cli-docker.svg)

1. Return to your build machine in your Azure Cloud Shell. Let's create a Docker image for our NPM application. Substitute your _server name_ in the following command.

``
sudo docker build -t <server name>.jfrog.io/docker-demo/npm-app:latest .
``

This command should result in a successful Docker image build.

Docker Hub has set a new limit on data transfer beginning November 1st for free accounts: 100 pulls for anonymous users and 200 pulls for authenticated/free users for every 6 hours per IP address or a unique user.

Artifactory can protect you from this by proxying and caching images! This reduces the number of pulls from Docker Hub.

Docker also has a 6 month retention policy for free accounts. You can avoid that as well by using Artifactory as your private registry.

2. Now use the JFrog CLI to push the docker image. Substitute your _server name_ in the following command.

``
sudo jfrog rt docker-push <server name>.jfrog.io/docker-demo/npm-app:latest docker-demo --build-name=npm_build --build-number=1
``

3. Now trigger a Xray scan of the build.

``
jfrog rt build-scan npm_build 1
``

This command should result in successful scanning.

4. If our build passes the Xray scan, we can promote it with the following command. This promotes from the _dev_ repository to the _prod_ repository. Substitute your _server name_ in the following command.

``
jfrog rt docker-promote npm-app docker-demo-dev-local docker-demo-prod-local
``

5. In your JFrog Platform instance, go to **Artifactory** â–º **Artifacts** to see this in the docker repositories.
