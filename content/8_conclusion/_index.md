In this workshop, we used the JFrog Platform to build an application, manage the artifacts, scan the artifacts for security vulnerabilities and license compliance, and publish the artifacts of your application to a staging repository. Then we used Azure AKS to deploy your application so that end-users can access it. 
The JFrog Platform and Azure AKS to demonstrate how you can build a DevOps cloud platform on Azure to delivery your software to your end-users. This modernizes your software delivery life cycle enabling your organization to deliver quality software continuously by leveraging advanced cloud services and elastic infrastructure.
