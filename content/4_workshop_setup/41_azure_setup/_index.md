In this section, we will setup our Azure environment. We will:
 
- Set up an Azure account if one doesn't already exist.
- Configure the Azure Cloud Shell.
- Download the workshop code.
- Create the AKS cluster. 

Please choose if you are running the workshop on your own or attending an Azure event.
