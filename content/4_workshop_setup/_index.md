Before we get started on building, publishing and deploying our application, we must set up our workshop environment. In this setup section, we will:

- Set up our Azure account and environment.
- Configure the Azure Cloud Shell.
- Clone our workshop GitHub repository which contains our code.
- Prepare our JFrog Platform instance.
