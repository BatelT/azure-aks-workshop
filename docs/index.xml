      <title>Continuous Integration and Delivery</title>

      <description>Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) is the process for which your software components are built from code, integrated, tested, released, deployed and ultimately delivered to end-users. CI/CD pipelines are the software assembly line that orchestrates the building of your software. This CI/CD pipeline line requires infrastructure. Cloud computing has allowed this infrastructure to become dynamic and ephemeral. On cloud infrastructure, your CI/CD pipelines scale up and down to meet your software delivery demands.</description>

      <title>Binary Repository Management</title>
      <link>https://jfrogtraining.github.io/azureworkshop/2_devops_cloud/22_binary_repository_management.html</link>

      <description>A Binary Repository Manager is a software hub that simplifies the development process for different teams across an organization by helping them to collaborate on building coherent and compatible software components. It does this by centralizing the management of all the binary artifacts generated and used by the organization, thereby overcoming the incredible complexity arising from diverse binary artifact types, their position in the overall workflow and the set of dependencies between them.</description>

      <description>Any security issue identified by a security scanning may be reviewed by a small security team that may lack the technical knowledge. This challenge can be reduced by shifting left to the developer and operations teams, making them also responsible for security and compliance. This moves security earlier in the software delivery process. Source code, dependency and artifact security scanning are some examples of moving security into the development process. Implementing the identification of security issues earlier in the CI/CD pipeline, as well as automating security and compliance policies in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), rather than using manual processes, is crucial.</description>

      <description>Azure Cloud Shell does not include a Docker daemon by default. We can configure a remote Docker daemon instead with the following steps.
 In your Azure Cloud Shell, execute the following command to create a remote Docker daemon machine. This will take a few minutes.  SUB_ID=$(az account show --query &amp;quot;id&amp;quot; -o tsv) docker-machine create -d azure \ --azure-subscription-id $SUB_ID \ --azure-ssh-user azureuser \ --azure-open-port 80 \ --azure-size &amp;quot;Standard_DS2_v2&amp;quot; \ docker-vm When this complete, execute the following to configure Azure Cloud Shell to use this remote Docker daemon machine.</description>

      <description>Before deploying an AKS cluster for the NPM application, we must first set up the required networking with the following steps.
 Execute the following command to create a virtual network for the AKS cluster.  az network vnet create \ --resource-group jfrog-azure-workshop \ --location westus \ --name aks-vnet \ --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/8 \ --subnet-name aks-subnet \ --subnet-prefixes 10.240.0.0/16 Retrieve and store the resultant subnet ID in an environment variable.  SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet show \ --resource-group jfrog-azure-workshop \ --vnet-name aks-vnet \ --name aks-subnet \ --query id -o tsv) echo $SUBNET_ID Now we are ready to create an AKS cluster.</description>

      <guid>https://jfrogtraining.github.io/azureworkshop/4_workshop_setup/42_jfrog_setup/423_jfrog_cli.html</guid>
      <description>JFrog CLI is a client that provides a simple CLI interface that automates the management of JFrog products. JFrog CLI works with JFrog Artifactory, JFrog Mission Control, JFrog Bintray and JFrog Xray (through their respective REST APIs) making your scripts more efficient and reliable. You can use the JFrog CLI to assist in your builds, create artifacts, promote artifacts, trigger security scans and much more. It is powerful to that you can use in your CI/CD process and general automation.</description>

      <title>Configure JFrog Artifactory and Xray</title>
      <link>https://jfrogtraining.github.io/azureworkshop/4_workshop_setup/42_jfrog_setup/424_configure_jfrog.html</link>

      <guid>https://jfrogtraining.github.io/azureworkshop/4_workshop_setup/42_jfrog_setup/424_configure_jfrog.html</guid>
      <description>Now that we have the JFrog CLI installed and configured, we will use it to create the Artifactory NPM and docker repositories, Xray watches and policies. We will need these when we build and publish our NPM application later. The JFrog CLI uses the the JFrog Platform REST APIs. This is another way that you can manage and monitor the JFrog Platform.
 In your Azure Cloud Shell, change directory to the azureworkshop directory that you cloned previously.</description>
